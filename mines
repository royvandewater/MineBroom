% This solver checks to see what spots are mines
% The safe spot solver is in another castle ("safesquares")

% The idea is to return a list of all previously unknown locations
% That we now know to be mines

% There cannot be more mines adjacent to a safesquare than the value indicated
% choose at most C adjacent mines
C{ mine(A1,B1) : adjacent(A1,B1,A2,B2) }C :- safe(A2,B2,C).

% define when something is definately not a mine
% A safe square is definately not a mine
:- safe(R1, C1, N), mine(R1, C1).

#hide.
#show mine/2.
#show not_a_mine(A1, B1).
