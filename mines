% This solver checks to see what spots are mines
% The safe spot solver is in another castle ("safesquares")

% The idea is to return a list of all previously unknown locations
% That we now know to be mines

% Try to find mines, m is the max number of remaining mines
% { mine(X,Y) : row(X) : col(Y) }m.

% There cannot be more mines adjacent to a safesquare than the value indicated

% choose at most A adjacent mines
C{ mine(A1,B1) : adjacent(A1,B1,A2,B2) }C :- safe(A2,B2,C).

% define when something is definately not a mine
% A safe square is definately not a mine
% :- safe(R1, C1, N), mine(R1, C1).

% A mine is unfree if it is adjacent to at least one safe square
% unfree(R1,C1) :- mine(R1,C1), safe(R2,C2,N2), adjacent(R1,C1,R2,C2).

% For us to realize that this is a mine, it has to be adjacent to at least
% one safe square (So if there are no adjacent squares, exclude it
% :- mine(R1,C1), safe(R2,C2,N2), not unfree(R1,C1).
