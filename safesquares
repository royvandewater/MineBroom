% This solver checks to see what spots are safe
% The mines checker is called "mines"

% The idea is to return a list of all previously unknown locations
% That we now know to be safe

% The input is normallized so the value of each known safe square is
% subtracted by the number of known adjacent mines

% define when something is definately a mine
% to be a mine, its nescessary (but not sufficent) for all adjacent
% squares to have a number showing

1{ safe(X,Y) : row(X) : col(Y) }1.
