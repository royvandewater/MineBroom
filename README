Sweeper 0.1 -- An implementation of the classic Minesweeper game
including ASP solver. Code based on pysweeper by Brett Smith

This application requires that Python2.6 and PyGTK be installed. On Debian
based systems, simply run: 

sudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-gtk2

To run the solver, GRINGO and CLASP must be installed and on the system path.
GRINGO and CLASP can be downloaded from:

http://potassco.sourceforge.net/

To run the solver on any of the test cases provided, use the following command:

gringo -c r=<rnum> -c c=<cnum> -c n=<max> mineBroom <caseFile> | clasp 0

So to run it on case5, you would run

gringo -c r=4 -c c=5 -c n=5 mineBroom case5 | clasp 0
